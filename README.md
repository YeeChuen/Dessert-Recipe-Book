# Dessert Recipe Book

## Summary 
Dessert Recipe Book is an IOS mobile application that contains dessert recipes from themealdb.com(An open, crowd-sourced database of Recipes from around the world). 
In the Dessert Recipe Book app, users can explore various dessert recipes from around the world, and the best thing of all is to taste them!

## Project Goal
This project is written in Swift using SwiftUI in Xcode application.
Note that this project is given as an exercise by Fetch company as well.

The goal of this project is to learn the Swift programming language as well as SwiftUI, which aims to expand my full-stack development knowledge.
In this project, basic SwiftUI techniques were explored, creating View, Function, Class, and basic restAPI is used(leveraging public online APIs from themealdb.com).

## Future
themealdb.com has tons of APIs to be explored. For future improvement, the Dessert Recipe Book will reveal more interesting facts and information about each desserts!
